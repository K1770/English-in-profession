It also stores the intermediate and final results of processing. After completing the processing, the obtained results are transmitted to the output device.</span></p><p style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; padding-left: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0;" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: 'Bitter'; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">The primary memory stores the data only when the power is on. When there is no power the data stored in the primary memory will be lost. The primary memory is also sometimes referred as main memory, temporary memory or volatile memory. This memory works faster than secondary memory. RAM is an example of primary memory. The primary memory of modern computers is made of semiconductor devices.</span></p><p style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; padding-left: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0;" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q" dir="ltr" id="h.dumtdc7me55w"><span style="font-family: 'Bitter'; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Secondary memory</span></p><p style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; padding-left: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0;" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: 'Bitter'; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">The secondary memory is also called as non-volatile memory or permanent memory.

    <string name="cpu"><p style="text-align: center;">CPU (Central Processing Unit)</p> The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is considered as the brain of computer. A central processing unit is an electronic circuit that carries out the instructions of a computer program. It performs basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output operations. The user or human being writes a program to the computer. Computers do not have  intelligence, so they could not perform any operations on their own. Hence, all the instructions to the computer are given by the user to perform specific task. CPU controls operations on all parts of the computer including main memory. CPU is also sometimes referred as central processor, microprocessor, or simply processor. It is the most important part of a computer system. In all modern small computers, the CPU is placed on a single silicon chip. Hence, the size of CPU is reduced. CPU consists of two main components: ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) Control unit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations. In some computers, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is divided in two parts: Arithmetic unit (AU) and Logic Unit (LU). The arithmetic unit performs the arithmetic operations and the logic unit performs the logical operations. The various arithmetic operations performed by the Arithmetic Unit (AU) include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Arithmetic unit performs these arithmetic operations at high speed. The various logical operations performed by the Logic Unit (LU) include NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, etc. The results of the ALU are stored in memory for further use. The results that are stored in the memory are passed to output devices. The control unit controls all the operations of the computer. It tells the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), computers memory, input and output devices how to respond to the program instructions. It controls the flow of data between CPU and other devices. The control unit efficiently manages the resources of the computer to reduce power consumption. It also checks the correctness of the sequence of operations. The devices, which requires control unit, include Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).</string>

    <string name="webcam"><p style="text-align: center;">Webcam</p> In 1991, the first webcam was up and running at Cambridge University\'s  <b>Computer Science</b> Department, but since then, webcams have crept into homes, businesses, public streets and buildings. Webcams are often used for personal use in the home by parents who want to give distant relatives visual access to their children or want to monitor what goes on in the home while they are at work. People might also use webcams in the home to keep an eye on things while they are out of town or even just to see what their pets do all day. The uses of a webcam are limitless. Businesses often use webcams for <b>video conferencing</b>, and webcam technology is used by numerous other entities to give the public access to a variety of information, from weather and traffic to the feeding habits of the most recently acquired zoo animal. Some schools and day care facilities use a webcam to allow parents to see what their children do at school.</string>

    <string name="carMechanicsMainText1">A car mechanic is a service professional who maintains and repairs automotive vehicles. He or she might work on cars and trucks that operate using a traditional fuel like gasoline, or a non-traditional fuel such as ethanol or electricity. This type of mechanic\'s job may require expertise in all parts and components of a vehicle or the mechanic may specialize in a particular area such as engines, brakes, electrical systems or emissions equipment.</string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText2"><b>A mechanic may work for a shop that does tune ups and general maintenance</b></string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText3">Automotive mechanics may be employed by many different types of companies. Car dealerships commonly have a repair and maintenance department that employs mechanics. A car mechanic can also find work at repair shops, service stations and automobile leasing companies. Jobs of this type can also be obtained at car manufacturing plants where new cars require inspection before being shipped to dealerships. A significant number of car mechanics are self-employed.</string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText4"><b>Car mechanics should have good communication and analytical skills.</b></string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText5">Before the advent of high tech automotive diagnostic equipment, a car mechanic commonly had to heavily rely upon knowledge and experience to isolate automotive problems and correct them. Customers typically described the problem to the mechanic, and the mechanic put the car through a series of manual tests until the source of the problem was determined. After conferring with the customer on the options of repair and replacement costs, the car mechanic went to work to fix the problem.</string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText6"><b>A car mechanic can test or replace a vehicle\'s battery.</b></string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText7">Although a car mechanic today still benefits from hands-on experience, he or she is also generally required to know how to use electronic equipment and specialized software that helps diagnose automotive problems. This sophisticated equipment can be used to measure pressurized systems, analyze electrical system problems and diagnose engine and carburetor glitches. One of the earliest and most used electronic diagnostic systems analyzes automobile emissions to determine if they meet standards imposed by environmental protection agencies.</string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText8"><b>A car mechanic may choose to work at a car dealership.</b></string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText9">Success as a car mechanic normally requires good communication skills and good analytical abilities. Non-professionals commonly lack the language skills to clearly describe automotive problems, so a mechanic is regularly required to interpret their descriptions of a car’s malfunctions.</string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText10"><b>Car mechanics know how to use power tools, such as an air wrench</b></string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText11">A high school diploma or equivalent is usually required of potential car mechanics. Classes in computer operations, math, mechanical analysis and science are strongly preferred for aspiring automotive technicians. A considerable and growing number of employers require applicants for this position to complete an automotive repair training program at a local college or vocational school. Professional certification is also sometimes required to be hired as a car mechanic.</string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText12"><b>Car mechanics are responsible for replacing a vehicle\'s fluids.</b></string>
    <string name="carMechanicsMainText13"><b>Today\'s mechanics need to be able to interface with a car\'s onboard computer.</b></string>

    <string name="electrical_system">Electrical system</string>
    <string name="earth_return_system">Earth-return system</string>
    <string name="apart_from_the_main">Apart from the main charging, starting and ignition circuits, there are other circuits that power lights, electric motors, the sensors and gauges of electrical instruments, heating elements, magnetically operated locks, the radio and so on. All Circuits are opened and closed either by switches or by relays - remote switches operated by electromagnets.\nCurrent flows along a single cable from the battery to the component being powered, and back to the battery through the car\'s metal body. The body is connected to the earth terminal of the battery by a thick cable.</string>
    <string name="in_a_negative_earth_system">In a negative (-) earth-return system, the current flows from the positive (+) terminal to the component being operated. The component is earthed to the car body, which is earthed to the negative (-) terminal of the battery.\nThis type of circuit is called an earth-return system any part of it connected to the car body is said to be earthed.\nThe strength of the current is measured in amperes (amps); the pressure that drives it round the circuit is called voltage ( volts ). Modern cars have a 12 volt battery. Its capacity is measured in amp/hours. A 56 amp/hour battery should be able to deliver a current of 1 amp for 56 hours, or 2 amps for 28 hours.\nIf the battery voltage drops, less current flows, and eventually there is not enough to make the components work.</string>
    <string name="current_voltage_and_resistance">Current, voltage and resistance</string>
    <string name="the_extent_to_which">The extent to which a wire resists the flow of current is called resistance , and is measured in ohms .\nThin wires conduct less easily than thick ones, because there is less room for the electrons to travel through.\nThe energy needed to push current through a resistance is transformed into heat. This can be useful, for example in the very thin filament of a light bulb, which glows white hot.\nHowever, a component with a high current consumption must not be connected using wires which are too thin, or the wires will overheat, blow a fuse , or burn out.\nAll the electrical units of measurement are interrelated: a pressure of 1 volt causes a current of 1 amp to flow through a resistance of 1 ohm. Volts divided by ohms equal amps. For example, a light bulb with a resistance of 3 ohms, in a 12 volt system, consumes 4 amps.\nThis means it must be connected using wires thick enough to carry 4 amps comfortably.\nOften the power consumption of a component will be stated in watts , which are found by multiplying amps and volts. The lamp in the example consumes 48 watts.</string>
    <string name="positive_and_negative_polarity">Positive and negative polarity</string>
    <string name="short_circuits_and_fuses">Short circuits and fuses</string>
    <string name="electricity_flows_from">Electricity flows from a battery in one direction only, and some components work only if the flow through them is in the correct direction.\nThis acceptance of a one-way flow is called polarity . On most cars the negative (-) battery terminal is earthed and the positive (+) one feeds the electrical system.\nThis is called a negative earth system, and when buying an electrical accessory a radio, for example check that it is of a type suitable for your car\'s system. Fitting a radio with the incorrect polarity will damage the set, but most car radios have an external switch for setting the polarity to suit that of the car. Switch to the correct setting before fitting.</string>
    <string name="if_the_wrong_sized_wire">If the wrong-sized wire is used, or if a wire becomes broken or disconnected, this can cause an accidental short circuit which bypasses the resistance of the component. The current in the wire may become dangerously high and melt the wire or cause a fire.</string>
    <string name="the_fuse_box_is_often">The fuse box is often located in a cluster of components, as illustrated here. The box is shown with the cover off.</string>
    <string name="to_guard_against_this">To guard against this, ancillary circuits have fuses.\nThe most common type of fuse is a short length of thin wire enclosed in a heatproof casing often glass.\nThe size of the fuse wire is the thinnest that can carry the normal current of the circuit without overheating, and it is rated in amps.\nThe sudden surge of high current in a short circuit makes the fuse wire melt, or \'blow\', breaking the circuit.\nWhen this happens, see if there is a short circuit or a disconnection, then install a new fuse of the correct amperage rating (See Checking and replacing fuses ).\nThere are many fuses, each protecting a small group of components, so that one blown fuse does not shut down the whole system. Many of the fuses are grouped together in a fuse box, but there may also be line fuses in the wiring.</string>
    <string name="series_and_parallel_circuits">Series and parallel circuits</string>
    <string name="a_circuit_usually_includes_more">A circuit usually includes more than one component, such as bulbs in the lighting circuits. It matters whether they are connected in series one after the other or in parallel side by side.\nA headlamp bulb, for example, is designed to have a degree of resistance so that it consumes a certain current to glow normally.\nBut there are at least two headlamps in the circuit. If they were connected in series, electric current would have to go through one headlamp to get to the other.\nThe current would encounter the resistance twice, and the double resistance would halve the current, so that the bulbs would glow only feebly.\nConnecting the bulbs in parallel means that electricity goes through each bulb only once.\nSome components must be connected in series. For example, the sender in the fuel tank varies its resistance according to the amount of fuel in the tank, and \'sends\' a small electrical current to the fuel gauge.\nThe two components are connected in series so that the varying resistance in the sender will affect the position of the needle on the gauge.</string>
    <string name="ancillary_circuits">Ancillary circuits</string>
    <string name="the_starter_motor_has">The starter motor has its own heavy cable, direct from the battery. The ignition circuit furnishes the high-tension impulses to the sparkplugs; and the charging system includes the generator , which recharges the battery. All the other circuits are called ancillary (subsidiary) circuits.\nMost are wired through the ignition switch , so that they work only when the ignition is switched on.\nThis prevents you accidentally leaving something switched on which might cause the battery to go flat.\nThe side and tail lights, however, which you may need to leave on when the car is parked, are always wired independently of the ignition switch.\nWhen fitting extra accessories, such as a rear window heater which consumes a heavy current, always wire it through the ignition switch.\nSome ancillary components can be operated without the ignition turned on by turning the switch to the \'auxiliary\' position. A radio is usually wired through this switch, so that it can be played with the engine off.</string>
